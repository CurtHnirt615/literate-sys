* Learning Fullstack Development: 
(https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/full-stack-development)
 + Frontend:Crafting engaging user interfaces
	> HTML, CSS, JavaScript
 + Backend: Powering the application's core
	> Django, Python, Java, Node.js, PHP, R, Ruby
	> Design and implement RESTful APIs

 + Database like MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL
			|-Database
Front end --> Back end 	|
			|-Third party services

Workflow (end-to-end): Full stack development
1- Planning and design
2- Front end development
3- Back end development
4- Testing and integration
5- Deployment and maintenance

Benefits of full stack developers
- Complete ownership and project understanding.
- Time and cost savings/enhanced productivity.
- Faster bug fixing and troubleshooting.
- Seamless knowledge transfer and collaboration.
- Optimal division of work and resource allocation.


** Prepare before Practice: 
1. Install Homebrew (if the system doesn't have it) 
    link: https://brew.sh/
2. Create Github account and the Respository
    - need to generate a new ssh-key (https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent )
    note: github cheat-sheet (https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
3. Learning React (https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/what-is-react-and-nextjs)
	* React Foundations:
		> Chapter 1: About React and Next.js
			> Building blocks of a web application
			. User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.
			. Routing - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
			. Data Fetching - where your data lives and how to get it.
			. Rendering - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
			. Integrations - what third-party services you use (for CMS, auth, payments, etc.) and how you connect to them
			. Infrastructure - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (serverless, CDN, edge, etc.).
			. Performance - how to optimize your application for end-users.
			. Scalability - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
			. Developer Experience - your team's experience building and maintaining your application.
		- React: JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces (UI) - users see and interact with on-screen
		- Next.js is a flexible React framework - to build blocks to create fast, full stack web application
